# Alphanumonly​

The `alphanumonly` filter removes tokens that contain non-ASCII characters, keeping only alphanumeric terms. This filter is useful for processing text where only basic letters and numbers are relevant, excluding any special characters or symbols.​

## Configuration​{#configuration​}

The `alphanumonly` filter is built into Milvus. To use it, simply specify its name in the `filter` section within `analyzer_params`.​

```Python
analyzer_params = {​
    "tokenizer": "standard",​
    "filter": ["alphanumonly"],​
}​

```

The `alphanumonly` filter operates on the terms generated by the tokenizer, so it must be used in combination with a tokenizer. For a list of tokenizers available in Milvus, refer to [​Tokenizer Reference](https://zilliverse.feishu.cn/wiki/Zu6vw6Aifi1gvNkqqO5cDjmtngh).​

After defining `analyzer_params`, you can apply them to a `VARCHAR` field when defining a collection schema. This allows Milvus to process the text in that field using the specified analyzer for efficient tokenization and filtering. For details, refer to [Example use](https://zilliverse.feishu.cn/wiki/H8MVwnjdgihp0hkRHHKcjBe9n5e#share-I38Md0nO2o1lw2xifGzccPpWncd).​

## Example output​{#example-output​}

Here’s an example of how the `alphanumonly` filter processes text:​

**Original text**:​

```Python
"Milvus 2.0 @ Scale! #AI #Vector_Databasé"​

```

**Expected output**:​

```Python
["Milvus", "2", "0", "Scale", "AI", "Vector"]​

```
